# 🌐 AI-Driven Development – 30-Day Challenge

## 📝 Task 7 

## **What is SPECKit Plus?**

Spec-Kit Plus is a way of building software that says:

**👉 Don’t just write code, also save the thinking behind the code.**

Every time you build a feature, you produce two things:

## **1. The Code (temporary)**
-	This is the part that actually runs the feature.
-	It works today, but it might be rewritten later.
-	It depends on the current tools, language, or project.

## **2. The Reusable Intelligence (permanent)**

This is all the thinking you did while building:

-	**Reasoning Patterns:** Why you chose one solution instead of another
-	**Decision Frameworks:** How you make decisions for similar problems
-	**Prompt Templets:** Prompts or methods that helped you solve it
-	This goes into a history/ folder so future you (or your team) can reuse it

# **Short answer of core concepts of `/constitution`, `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/implement`**

## **•	`/constitution`: **

Like deciding: “What does a good research paper look like? What standards must we follow?” It’s the quality rulebook.	
    
## **•	`/specify`:**

You turn unclear ideas into **clear, testable requirements**.
It’s like telling a kid:
“Clean your room” → **unclear**
“Put toys in the box, fold clothes, throw trash away, make the bed” → **clear**  
	
## **•	`/plan`:**

You create the **architecture and design**.
For a research paper, this means creating the outline, section structure, and method.
It’s your **blueprint**.
 
## **•	`/tasks`:**

You break everything into **tiny, manageable tasks**. It’s your **to-do list**, but extremely clear.

## **•	`/implement`:**

You actually do the work, step by step, with AI helping where useful. This is where the real writing or coding happens.
